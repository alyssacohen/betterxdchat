# betterxdchat
Trying to improve the user experience with [XDress](http://xdress.it/xdforum "XDress forum") chat.

# WARNING
My scripts are super pre alpha software: they could work badly or not work at all. There is no warranty they will work, neither that they are safe to run.
## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! ##

## xdcsound.user.js
Restore lost functionality to play a "pop" sound on new messages.

If you have a script manager like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, you can [install xdcsound.user.js](https://github.com/alyssacohen/betterxdchat/raw/master/xdcsound.user.js) with just a click.
If you don't know what I am talking about, don't do nothing.


**TODO**: Option to switch sound on/off or just when unfocused
